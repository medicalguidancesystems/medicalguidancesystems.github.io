This business will develop strategies that will address the unmet medical need in developing new therapeutic agents to cancer. These novel strategies will focus on the development of therapeutic antibodies and conjugates for treatment of cancer.
MGS has four lead molecular targets that will be the basis for potential drug development platforms against solid tumors (excludes lymphoma and leukemia).  The lead antibody, Tiptuximab , will be humanized and then studies will be done to determine success in the following platforms:

| Ligand directed &nbsp; | Antibody Directed               |
| -------------          | ----------------                |
| Radionuclide           | IgG                             |
| Liposome               | Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADC)  |
| Nanoparticle           | Radioimmunoconjugates (RIC)     |
| Viral Vector           | Immunotoxin                     |
|                        | Immunoliposome                  |

Each of the other three lead antibodies includes those developed against radiation induced antigens GRP78, TAF15, and 14-3-3.  These antibodies will undergo the same process as is described for Tiptuximab in the R&D section.  

MGS intends to commercialize this technology by sub -licensing to well established pharmaceutical companies.  Considerations regarding licensing to one or a number of companies will depend on interest of the various platforms.  We intend to reach these companies by attending conferences and publishing articles to gain the interests of these companies. We also anticipate Dr. Hallahan will have contacts in this field that will lead to collaborative efforts.   The goal is to execute an acquisition of MGS as an exit strategy within 5 years of when the company was founded.
