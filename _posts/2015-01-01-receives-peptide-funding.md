MEDICAL GUIDANCE SYTEMS receives funding from the National Cancer Institute to develop a peptide to treat cancer. The Chief Scientific Officer at MGS, Dennis Hallahan, MD, states “This research is the study of new paradigms in both the treatment of cancer and cancer drug development. This platform technology will markedly expand the number of cancer specific surface receptors and antigens that can be targeted for drug delivery using peptide ligands. The general principle of this new technology is that cancer cells respond to ionizing radiation through a stress response that involves membrane transport and presentation of stress proteins on the cell surface. These proteins are normally sequestered within the cancer cell but are transported to the surface in response to oxidative stress and DNA strand breaks
caused by ionizing radiation. We exploit this physiologic response by developing peptide ligands
that bind to radiation-inducible stress proteins with high affinity and specificity.”

Since 1998, the Hallahan lab has identified over 4 dozen radiation-inducible cell surface
proteins through the use of platform technologies. To identify candidate ligands for these
surface proteins, a phage display library representing over 2 billion peptides was injected into
the circulation of mice bearing irradiated cancers. Phage that bind to the irradiated tumors
were amplified and injected into another tumor-bearing mouse after irradiation. After 5
passages through irradiated tumors, peptides bind specifically to irradiated cancers. The cell
surface receptors for these peptides were identified by proteomic and genomic methods. The
resulting peptide ligand-receptor pairs have been prioritized by cancer specificity, prolonged
binding and binding to multiple cancer subtypes. The lead radiation inducible receptors that
achieve all of these criteria include TIP-1, and GRP-78. To develop drug delivery systems
targeting irradiated tumors, we will utilize peptide ligands to the lead receptors we have
identified. Conjugation of peptides to therapeutic agents can specifically deliver cytotoxic
agents to mouse models of human cancer. With this approach, they have improved tumor
control, pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of cancer drugs. They propose research to test the
hypothesis that inducible cell-surface proteins on cancer can be exploited to achieve cancer
specific drug delivery in patients. They will conjugate the lead peptide to PEG and chelators that
will serve to image the spatial and temporal distribution of peptides in planned clinical trials.
