MEDICAL GUIUDANCE SYTEMS receives funding from the National Cancer Institute to develop an antibody to treat cancer. The Chief Scientific Officer at MGS, Dennis Hallahan, MD, states “Poor prognosis cancers such as lung cancer, glioblastoma, pancreatic cancer and others have 3 year survival rates that range from 1%‐15%. Recent advancements in the development of therapeutic antibodies have shown promise in other cancers such as breast, head and neck, and colon cancer. The limitations in antibody development are the paucity of cancer specific antigens and the heterogeneity within cancer cells. To address these limitations, we have discovered and prioritized inducible antigens in cancer. During treatment with radiation, cancer demonstrates an exaggerated stress response that is not observed in normal tissues. We have discovered 42 inducible proteins in a wide range of cancers. These have been prioritized upon cancer specificity and the wide spectrum of cancer subtypes that show induction.”

The lead antibody to inducible antigen shows cancer specificity and prolonged binding on the
surface of cancer cells. In the proposed STTR, they will characterize tiptuximab, which is a therapeutic
antibody that binds specifically to radiation inducible TIP1 on cancer. This research proposal addresses
an unmet medical need through the development of antibodies to poor prognosis cancers. More
specifically, lung cancer is among the largest markets in oncology. The goal is to bring the antibody into
clinical trials to demonstrate the clinical proof of concept of targeting therapeutic antibodies specifically
to cancer by exploiting inducible antigens. They have prioritized our lead mouse monoclonal antibody
based on cancer specificity and efficacy. They next humanized this antibody and will now conduct
preclinical imaging and biodistribution studies. Following the preclinical proof of concept, they will apply for Phase 2 STTR studies which will fund preclinical safety and subsequent clinical studies of the antibody. The goals of the proposed research are to: 1) Image the radiolabeled antibody in mouse models of lung cancer. 2) Study the immune response activated by tiptuximab in human cancers.
This research will advance the field of cancer drug development by demonstrating a new paradigm of
development of antibodies to inducible antigens in cancer. This research will also address an unmet
medical need in developing new therapeutic agents to lung cancer.
