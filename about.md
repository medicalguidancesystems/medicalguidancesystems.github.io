## Mission

The mission of MGS is to provide new therapeutic opportunities for patients who have been diagnosed with poor prognosis cancers.  Poor prognosis cancers such as lung cancer, glioblastoma, pancreatic cancer and others have 3 year survival rates that range from 1%‚Äê15%. Recent advancements in the development of therapeutic antibodies have shown promise in other cancers such as breast, head and neck, and colon cancer. The limitations in antibody development are the paucity of cancer specific antigens and the heterogeneity within cancer cells. To address these limitations, we have discovered and prioritized inducible antigens in cancer. During treatment with radiation, cancer demonstrates an exaggerated stress response that is not observed in normal tissues. We have discovered inducible proteins in a wide range of cancers. These have been prioritized upon cancer specificity and the wide spectrum of cancer subtypes that show induction. Our lead antibodies to inducible antigens show cancer specificity and prolonged binding on the surface of cancer cells. 

This drug development platform addresses an unmet medical need through the development of antibodies to poor prognosis cancers. More specifically, lung cancer is among the largest markets in oncology. Our goal is to bring Tiptuximab into clinical trials to demonstrate the clinical proof of concept of targeting therapeutic antibodies specifically to cancer by exploiting inducible antigens.

The goals of the company are to demonstrate pre- clinical proof of concept; followed by early phase clinical trials to demonstrate clinical proof of concept of our cancer therapeutics.  These goals will be obtained from both partnering relationships in addition to licensing our technology to various companies.  We envision the various licensees using our platforms for drug development in ways that fit their business model and goals.  In Lieu of payment, partners will share ownership of created IP based on contractual work they perform creating the components of our drugs we need assistance with.
