## Industry

The antibody drug conjugate (ADC) market is relatively new to the industry. To date the FDA has approved three ADCs. Of ADCs in active development, about 60% are in preclinical development while 30% are in phase I clinical trials.  An in-depth search concluded that it appears there is no ADC, RIC or any other platform under investigation that uses the TIP1 antigen for any cancer therapy to date.  A patent search indicates that there is only one other application TIP1 is used for outside of Dr. Hallahanâ€™s intended use, and that is for treatment of tissue damage.   Cancer therapeutic antibody sales are expected to be more than $27 billion by 2018, and steadily climbing even beyond 2018. 

## Competitive Advantage

We have discovered inducible proteins in a wide range of cancers. These have been prioritized upon cancer specificity and the wide spectrum of cancer subtypes that show induction. Our lead antibodies to inducible antigens show cancer specificity and prolonged binding on the surface of the irradiated cancer cells.  There are a limited percentage of patients that have over expression of these antigens on cancer.  

The Hallahan lab is working to discover inducible antigens in cancer.  This strategy expands the number of cancer antigens that can be targeted for development of therapeutic antibodies. The antibodies can then be used for drug delivery or activation of an immune response.

## Growth Strategy

MGS will begin with initial funding in October 2014, and continue to achieve milestones pertaining to drug development over the course of the next few years. Growth will follow phase 2 SBIR funding.

BioGenerator has agreed to provide space for MGS to conduct the research required under the STTR grant, in addition to considering additional funding for the proposed initial phases of drug development.
