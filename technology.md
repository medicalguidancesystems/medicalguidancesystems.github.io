We and others have shown that Lung cancer continues to have a poor prognosis despite aggressive multimodality therapy. Therapeutic antibodies have shown promise in treatment of other cancers, such as breast cancer and head and neck cancer. The limitations of therapeutic antibody development in lung cancer are due to the paucity of cancer specific antigens and heterogeneity within lung cancer cells. Genotoxic stress induces the stress response resulting in protein translocation to the surface. Radiation inducible antigens add substantially to the number of antigenic targets for the development of therapeutic antibodies . We have identified stress proteins that are markedly overexpressed in lung cancer due to cancers ability to survive within hypoxia, hypoglycemia and acidosis. We have developed antibodies that bind to novel radiation inducible antigens.

Our preliminary data show that our monoclonal antibodies selectively target irradiated cancer in mouse models and activates immune effector cells. We have also conjugated our antibodies to cytotoxic agents and radiopharmaceuticals to deliver cytotoxic therapy to cancer. We have completed preclinical proof of concept using mouse monoclonal antibodies. Our lead antibody to Tax Interacting Protein 1 (TIP1) has been humanized (Tiptuximab) for planned clinical trials. The commercial opportunity is several-fold: First, IgG1 is effective at activating an immune response to cancer. Secondly, antibody drug conjugates have been shown to be very effective at delivering cytotoxic agents to cancer. These agents have received approval by the FDA for antibody guided drug delivery. Third, immunotoxins and other forms of drug delivery also have commercial potential . In the Phase 2 application, we will study therapeutic efficacy by using antibody conjugates. We plan to conduct clinical proof of concept by imaging antibody binding to cancer in patients receiving radiotherapy.

This is a platform technology that is a technological innovation. We utilized phage displayed peptide libraries to identify peptides that bind within irradiated cancers in mouse models. We discovered 42 unique peptides that will specifically bind within cancers in mice following irradiation. These peptides were then used for affinity purification of the binding partner in cancer. We have now discovered over a dozen radiation inducible antigens using this approach. We then prioritized these antigens based upon the duration of expression, specificity to cancer and accessibility to antibody and nanoparticle binding.

This approach challenges the paradigm of targeting only constitutively expressed antigens in cancer. Inducible antigens increase the number of molecular targets for antibody development. We have used two approaches in developing human antibodies for targeting radiation inducible neoantigens. The first is to select the lead mouse monoclonal antibody and engineer this into a human IgG1. This requires cloning of the CDR region into the human IgG1 gene. The second approach is to use the human single chain antibody library expressed on bacteriophage. These single chain reagents of the antibody are then cloned onto the human IgG1 Fc domain. The present application is for our lead humanized antibody, Tiptuximab, which binds selectively to irradiated cancer. These platform technologies and this new paradigm in treating cancer holds promise to improve both drug development and treatment of cancer. This new paradigm in antibody development will expand the number of therapeutic targets for antibody selection and development. This approach will also add an additional method for treating lung cancer.

Preliminary Data: The cancer specific binding of 2C6F3 mAb to irradiated cancer in hind limbs of nude mice is shown in Fig 1. Tumors grew to a size of 0.5 cm in diameter before irradiation (3 Gy) on the right-sided tumor whereas the left tumor in the same mouse was used as an untreated control tumor. The labeled antibody was injected into mice bearing irradiated tumors. 20 ug of anti-TIP1 antibodies-AlexaFluor 750 or control IgG were injected in the dorsal tail vein after irradiation. Biodistribution of the labeled antibodies within the tumor-bearing mice was monitored by near infrared imaging (NIR). The antibody was cleared from the circulation through enterohepatic excretion over the course of 48 hours. Antibody binding to irradiated tumors was observed within 24 hours and persisted beyond 5 days (Figure 1).
